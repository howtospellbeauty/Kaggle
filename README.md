# Training Tasks

In order to be more proficient in data analysis or use deep learning to solve practical problems, at the same time be familiar with the process of Kaggle competition. I chose some classic data analysis problems and some classic data sets to try to solve and analyze. These include the classic Titanic survival problem, using PyTorch to analyze MINST data, etc.
